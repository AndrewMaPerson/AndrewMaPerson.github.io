            Still love this place.
            If you're in the mood for some spicy garlic flavor, I highly recommend the Sichuan Fish. Comes in a broth with garlic and chili oil. If you don't want spicy, but still a garlic lover, the chicken mushroom wonton soup is also solid. This is my go-to when I'm sick. In fact, it tastes even better as leftovers, giving the garlic broth time to absorb into the wontons. (Can you tell I love garlic?)

            Now that I've become a regular, the lady recognizes me and smiles. It's interesting how the language barrier has softened a bit between us for simply being familiar faces. I recall how anxious and cold she used to seem when she tried to understand what I'm ordering my first few visits, but she's so warm and friendly now. I guess she's just introverted like me. Hope she can stick around for a long time. I really enjoy bringing my friends here.

            Wow!
            <br><br>
            That was super tasty! Finally a place that knows how to make real Chinese BBQ pork.
            <br><br>
            Showed up thinking it was just a Boba tea joint, but they offered more food and were limited to 6 different tea flavors and 3 types of boba.
            <br><br>
            So, we ordered mango and jasmine green tea, as well as pork & chicken wings and black pepper beef ribs.
            <br><br>
            The lady was super sweet. The language barrier was apparent when I asked some simple questions about the different tea flavors she offered, but being patient she eventually understood!
            <br><br>
            She was running the joint all by herself! Show some patience for the one-woman restaurant team. The wait was worth it because the food was delicious! The mango tea was lightly sweet and smooth, would recommend. The jasmine green tea wasn't so great, wouldn't recommend. But looking forward to trying the other food she offers!

            Yummy and authentic dim sum. Entrees are also good. I enjoyed the honey garlic chicken.

            Hidden in a business park, but worth discovering. They offer lots of dim sum options and even have vegan entrees available. Wonderful family-run establishment! Let's support local!
