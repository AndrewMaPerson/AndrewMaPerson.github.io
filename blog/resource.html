    <p>I served as a <a href="https://senatedemocrats.wa.gov/wilson/2023/02/28/andrew-ma-serves-as-page-in-washington-state-senate/"  target="_blank">Senate Page</a> during Mid-Winter break in Feburary 
        with my 30th District Senator Claire Wilson. Morgan Palumbo was also there! Sen. Wilson and 
        I talked for a long time about all sorts of stuff like campaigning; she walked over half a 
    million steps during here first campaign! Her election was the second most expensive in state history, 
    spending half a million dollars on campaiging in a purple district.</p>
    <p>I have a great time in school, reading and talking my way into middle and high school debate. 
        Currently I’m Speech & Debate captain and my primary event is Extemp. In extemporaneous speaking, 
        we are given 3 questions about current events, and we have 30 minutes to prepare a memorized,
         7 minute long speech giving a nuanced answer backed by complex analysis, citing a good 6-10 sources
          along the way. It’s hard- I’m getting better every week. I also realized this was similar 
         to Congressional debate, except with time constraints.  Then I thought: Why not do Congressional debate in real life, 
         and make an impact? I acted on that thought, and my mom generously drove me down to Olympia on my day
          off from school. So yes, I have become a “fast and smooth talker”, but I’m trying to use it for good. 
          I told my crewmates (rowing) about what I did, and they were very surprised and wanted to get involved.
           They simply hadn’t known. Here is the website for the <a href="https://www.speechanddebate.org/"  target="_blank">National Speech and Debate Association.</a>
           You can learn about the different events that high schoolers do! (There's like 2 dozen.)</p>

    <p>I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMweEpGlu_U" target="_blank">Butter.</a> No, not the ingredient, the song. By BTS.
    Weirdly, I'm kind of known for this. Some people don't even know my name; I'm just "Butter Boy". You can ask
    some random upper schoolers and they'll agree with this assessment. This summer I went to Yellowstone, and I filmed
    + edited a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeoncgAOoCc"  target="_blank">Butter MV.</a> . I hadn't recorded the vocals
    yet, so I just put in the backing track and cut in some dance moves. I'm a lot better now, but it's fun video I 
    edited in an hour. </p>
    <p>One last thing: I like singing, so here is Whitney Houston's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lCmBvYMRs&t=81s"  target="_blank">National Anthem</a>, which I have sung at 
        many of our volleyball games!
