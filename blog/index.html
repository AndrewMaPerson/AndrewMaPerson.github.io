    <h1 id="orange-text">It's me, hi, I'm the problem it's me.</h1>
    
    <h2 id="beige-background">This webpage is about my "genius". Well, my "genius" is me! It sounds a little
        wierd and pompus, but it's kind of true. My brand is what I'm known for. It's what got me where
    I am today. So this website is a little bit of an "about me". </h2>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 123);"> My life experience: When I was 6 years old, I landed in America with my mom. We moved into a one-bedroom apartment, ironically with one coffee table and no bed. So we slept on the floor. Years later, I still sleep on the floor from time to time despite our house having three beds. I went to our local public school, where I met kids of drastically different backgrounds. In Kindergarten, a girl from the Marshall Islands who was here without her parents because they could only afford one plane ticket. In first grade, a Hispanic boy whose dad cut grass for a living taught me how to count to ten, a skill that still helps me in Spanish class. In third grade, a boy from war-torn Afghanistan who had a 20-year-old mom, was really good at math and dreamed of becoming the next Messi. Within our different lives, we had something in common: we were all immigrants in a new country. </p>
    <p style="color:rgb(4, 28, 83)"> Yes, I really pulled the "life story" move just now. But it is a big part of me. Even though I had it hard
        I still had a great childhood. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As you'll read about in resource, I like public speaking. I've done it since 4th grade, when I learned
        about the Higgs-Boson and made a video about it. I always found it easy to "vibe" with the audience
        which is hard for many. I also don't get as nervous. I actually gave my middle school graduation speech!
        (At Open Window.) This is something I'm relatively good at, so perhaps this is my "genius".

    <p id="fontP">During my road trip to Yellowstone, pictured below, I listened to <em>A Promised Land</em>, which inspired me to run for office.
    A very small office, anyways. Learn more in "gallery"! </p>
