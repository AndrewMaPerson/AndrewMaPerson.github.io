    <h2 id="beigeBackground">One of my favorite things about school is debate club! </h2>
    <p>So in debate for about 5 months a year we practice twice a week.
         In practices we goof around or write/practice our speeches. <br>
        In debate, I actually do speech. That's why it's known as "speech and debate".
        In speech, I'm relatively good at extemp, where they give you 30 minutes to write and memorize a 7 minute
        political speech about politics, citing 6 sources! All memorized! I <em>like</em> it because it trains
    my public speaking and memorization and research skills. I'm currently seeking election in SLC so I made a 
HOPE poster.</p>
